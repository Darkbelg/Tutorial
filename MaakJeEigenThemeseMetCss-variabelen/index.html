            <h2>The tutorial</h2>
            <p>As developers the ability to store common values for reuse is extremely valuable, it saves time in both authoring and maintaining a codebase. This is why you’ll find variables a key part of any CSS pre-processor, such as Sass or LESS. The CSS Variables spec finally introduces this ability natively to CSS and there’s now a good level of browser support available to start putting them into use.</p>
            <p>However, you may have been thinking, since CSS pre-processors have variables already and are so prevalent these days, what’s the big deal? Fuelled by this I decided to take a look at what CSS Variables will offer developers beyond simply storing values for reuse.</p>
            <p>There are two interesting aspects I’ve found lately when working with CSS Variables. Firstly they, like all CSS, are susceptible to the cascade. This means that you can give a CSS Variable a new value and it only effect the children of that CSS rule in the document.</p>
            <p>The second aspect is that CSS Variables can be accessed and updated by JavaScript at runtime. This means that through user actions, you could update a the styles on your site easily through a small amount of JavaScript. In this case, I’m going to look at using colour inputs to instantly update the theme of a website.</p>
